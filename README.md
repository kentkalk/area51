This is the C++ class code for an Unreal Engine 5.1 project.  I'm only posting this for personal archival sake, as I don't believe I can post the entire project but only the code that I created.  It's the movement and weapon controls for an FPS game with jumping, sprinting, and basic weapon firing.
